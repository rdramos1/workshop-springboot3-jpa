This project was developed during the **"Java COMPLETO - Object-Oriented Programming + Projects"** course by **N√©lio Alves** on Udemy.  
The goal is to practice **RESTful API** development concepts using **Spring Boot 3** and **JPA/Hibernate**.

## üìñ Overview

This application is a simple system for managing orders, users, categories, and products.  
It explores fundamental concepts such as:

- Object-relational mapping with **JPA/Hibernate**  
- Relationships between entities  
- Custom exception handling  
- Environment-specific profiles (test/dev)  
- Layered architecture in a Spring Boot application

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java 17**  
- **Spring Boot 3**  
- **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate**  
- **Maven**  
- **H2 Database** (in-memory database for testing)  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Features

- Create and list users, orders, and products  
- Relationships between orders, categories, and order items  
- Date handling with `Instant` and `ISO 8601`  
- Centralized exception handling
